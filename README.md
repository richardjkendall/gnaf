Some utilities for loading GNAF data into a database

Not much order to this yet, it needs to be cleaned up.

You can find the GNAF dataset here https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-19432f89-dc3a-4ef3-b943-5326ef1dbecc/details

You can also find another of my projects which uses this data here: https://github.com/richardjkendall/location-service
